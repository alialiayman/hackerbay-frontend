## Objectives
* Install and configure software needed for day-to-day work.
* Successfully run an application at each tier of our architecture.

## Steps
### Install development tools


#### Git and GitHub
We use Git as our version control system for ongoing development. Git is a distributed VCS, meaning it allows for individual developers to maintain their own code branching and merging on their local development environment. Git's official about page is a good resource for a quick overview of the features that set Git apart from other version control systems such as Subversion.

We use GitHub as our remote storage server. GitHub is a hosted version control system solution which adds many useful features on top of the basic Git workflow, including Pull Requests, which combine issue tracking, code review, and branch merging.

Install git. search google for "install git" to get the download link. Learn command like
git clone
git checkout -b
git add .
